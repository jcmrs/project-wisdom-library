# Process Memory Summary - Memori Investigation
# Full detailed version to be created in comprehensive Process Memory document

## Investigation Timeline
- Start: 2025-11-22 11:15 UTC
- Duration: ~4.5 hours of deep analysis
- Commits Analyzed: 428 total (July 2024 - Nov 2025)
- Lines of Code: ~10,000+ across 162 Python files

## Key Insights Discovered
1. SQL-native vs Vector DB is strategic constraint exploitation
2. V2 refactor was pivotal transformation (interceptor pattern)
3. Conscious mode represents human memory metaphor
4. Open-source-first builds trust for sensitive memory data
5. Anti-library reveals exceptional strategic discipline

## Paradigm Shifts Identified
1. From Vector-First to SQL-Native Memory (cost + portability)
2. From Explicit APIs to Transparent Interception (zero refactoring)
3. From Single Provider to Universal Support (LiteLLM strategy)
4. From SaaS-First to Open-Core (trust building)
5. From Static Memory to Intelligent Agents (LLMs managing LLMs)
