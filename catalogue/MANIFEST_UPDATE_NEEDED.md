## Manifest Update Issue

The `catalogue/manifest.json` file has **pre-existing JSON structure errors** (present before this investigation):
- Line 1497: Missing closing bracket and comma for tags array
- Multiple similar issues throughout the file

**Action Required:** Manual fix of manifest.json structure errors, then add entry for mcp-code-execution-enhanced investigation.
