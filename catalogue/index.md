## 📚 Long-Form Distillations (1)

### [Project Perplex - The Multi-Agent Collaboration Paradigm](../distillations/2025-11-18-perplex-ai-collaboration-paradigm.md)
**Date:** 2025-11-18 | **ID:** perplex-ai-collaboration-paradigm-2025-11-18  
**Status:** Complete | **Wisdom Level:** 4 (Paradigms & Meta-Patterns)

Comprehensive analysis of the perplex repository revealing fundamental paradigm shifts in AI-agent collaboration. Extracts mental models including "Enforcement Over Documentation," "Repository as Habitable Space for AI Minds," and the shift from "AI as Tool" to "AI as Team Member."

**Key Findings:**
- Multi-agent coordination requires infrastructure, not just guidelines
- Foundation-first pattern validated: 100% infrastructure, 0% code is success
- Workspace coordination manifest as critical layer between methodology and multi-agent reality
- Transferable patterns for ANY multi-agent AI development project

**Tags:** multi-agent, ai-collaboration, paradigm-shift, infrastructure, wisdom-level-4

## 🧠 Process Memory Entries (1)

### [Perplex Multi-Agent Collaboration Paradigm Analysis](../process_memory/2025-11-18-perplex-analysis-session.md)
**Date:** 2025-11-18 | **ID:** perplex-analysis-session-2025-11-18  
**Type:** Conceptual Investigation | **Confidence:** 0.92

Epistemic history documenting the analysis journey from initial task misunderstanding to complete Wisdom Ladder execution. Captures autonomous profiling process: inferring that user's interest in "AI-Human collaboration dynamics" + all Wisdom Ladder levels selected meant extracting paradigm-level concepts rather than feature documentation.

**Strategic Context (Inferred):** Based on Issue #7 selecting all Wisdom Ladder levels with stated interest in collaboration dynamics, investigation focused on extracting high-level conceptual patterns from multi-agent infrastructure rather than documenting Perplexity integration goals.

## 📋 Strategic Backlog (1)

### [Strategic Shift: From "AI as Enhanced Automation" → "AI as Team Member"](../backlog/2025-11-18-ai-collaboration-infrastructure-pattern.md)
**Date:** 2025-11-18 | **ID:** ai-collaboration-infrastructure-pattern-2025-11-18  
**Status:** Proposed | **Priority:** High

Paradigm shift proposal to treat AI agents as team members with cognitive limitations requiring coordination infrastructure. Derived from perplex analysis showing that "enforcement over documentation" and explicit agent identity/workspace boundaries prevent failures that guidelines alone cannot.

**Required Changes:**
- Cultural: Stop treating AI as stateless tools, start designing infrastructure for cognitive limits
- Process: Add agent identity management, workspace manifests, session automation
- Artifacts: Create reusable templates for AI-first repository patterns

**Success Indicators:** Zero workspace violations, <10% coordination intervention, agent handoffs complete autonomously

**Tags:** paradigm-shift, ai-collaboration, strategic-backlog, cultural-change
