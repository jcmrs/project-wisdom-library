# Contributing Guidelines

## Who Contributes?
- **AI agents:** Perform analyses, syntheses, and catalogue results.
- **Strategic Owners (Vision Holders):** Provide context, review ripples, and validate alignment when prompted.
- **No manual code review or syntax checking required—automated by workflows and scripts.**

## Workflow

1. Select whether your entry is atomic or long-form.
2. Use the correct template in `/templates/` (include process memory, analysis type, or distillation).
3. Place your entry in the correct folder.
4. Automated tools generate/update the index and catalogue.
5. If you have ideas for repository or process improvements, add them to `/backlog/` or `/ideas/`.

## Templates & Standards

- **Always use a submission template.**
- **Tag and link entries for automated catalogue update.**
- **Flag any sensitive materials; store them in `/sensitive/`.**
