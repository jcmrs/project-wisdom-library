# Project Wisdom Library

Welcome to the **Project Wisdom Library**—a centralized, AI-driven archive for conceptual distillations, investigations, and process memory across projects. This repository is designed for both atomic insights and deep philosophical analysis, providing a structured resource for strategic synthesis and future reuse by AI agents and vision owners.

## Purpose

- Store, catalogue, and synthesize conceptual distillations and strategic analyses.
- Support both atomic (quick) and long-form investigations.
- Preserve process memory, strategic decisions, lessons learned, and meta-patterns.
- Facilitate holistic system thinking and AI-first workflows.

## Features

- Automated indexing and cataloguing of all artifacts.
- Standardized templates for every type of investigation and analysis.
- Flexible folder structure supporting atomic insights, long-form distillations, process memory, backlog, and ideas.
- Dedicated support for process memory protocols and strategic context capture.

## Usage

1. Select your investigation type (atomic or long-form).
2. Use the templates provided in `/templates/`.
3. Save your result in the appropriate folder.
