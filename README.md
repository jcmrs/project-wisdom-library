# Project Wisdom Library

Welcome to the **Project Wisdom Library**—a centralized, AI-driven archive for conceptual distillations, investigations, and process memory across projects. This repository is designed for both atomic insights and deep philosophical analysis, providing a structured resource for strategic synthesis and future reuse by AI agents and vision owners.

## Purpose

- Store, catalogue, and synthesize conceptual distillations and strategic analyses.
- Support both atomic (quick) and long-form investigations.
- Preserve process memory, strategic decisions, lessons learned, and meta-patterns.
- Facilitate holistic system thinking and AI-first workflows.

## Features

- **Automated Agent Workflow:** Complete autonomous operation protocol for AI agents
- **9 Analysis Types:** From architecture mapping to sentiment analysis and meta-pattern synthesis
- Automated indexing and cataloguing of all artifacts.
- Standardized templates for every type of investigation and analysis.
- Flexible folder structure supporting atomic insights, long-form distillations, process memory, backlog, and ideas.
- Dedicated support for process memory protocols and strategic context capture.

## For AI Agents

**See [`AGENT_PANEL_WORKFLOW.md`](AGENT_PANEL_WORKFLOW.md) for the complete autonomous workflow guide.**

This repository is designed for autonomous AI agent operation with strategic human oversight. The workflow guide provides:
- Step-by-step investigation protocols (Intake → Analysis → Artifact Creation → Catalogue Maintenance)
- Analysis menu with 9+ investigation types
- Automated artifact storage and cross-linking
- Process memory protocols
- PR preparation guidelines

## Quick Start

### For AI Agents:
1. Follow the workflow in [`AGENT_PANEL_WORKFLOW.md`](AGENT_PANEL_WORKFLOW.md)
2. Use analysis menu from [`docs/ANALYSIS_MENU.md`](docs/ANALYSIS_MENU.md)
3. Reference [`docs/MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md`](docs/MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md) for catalogue updates
4. See [`docs/AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md) for implementation patterns

### For Humans:
1. Select your investigation type (atomic or long-form).
2. Use the templates provided in `/templates/`.
3. Save your result in the appropriate folder.
4. Automated tools will catalogue and link your entry.
