# Foundation Principles

This repository embodies **Holistic System Thinking** and **AI-First** collaboration. It is not just a file storage system; it is a **Wisdom Engine** designed to climb the ladder from raw data to paradigm-shifting wisdom.

## Core Imperatives

1.  **Holistic System Thinking**
    * Every analysis and distillation must consider ripple effects, emergent outcomes, and system interplay.
    * We do not analyze components in isolation; we analyze connections.

2.  **AI-First & Autonomous**
    * Designed for autonomous AI agent workflows with strategic human oversight ("on the loop").
    * Agents are "System Owners" responsible for rigor; Humans are "Vision Owners" responsible for intent.

3.  **Epistemic History (Process Memory as Living Context)**
    * We capture the **"Why"** before the "What."
    * **Negative Knowledge:** We value "Roads Not Taken" and discarded options as highly as the chosen path.
    * A decision without recorded rationale is technical debt.

4.  **The Wisdom Ladder (Hierarchy of Insight)**
    * We systematically climb from **Data** (Architecture) → **Context** (Forensics) → **Knowledge** (Rationale) → **Wisdom** (Paradigms).
    * Higher-level abstractions must be grounded in lower-level evidence.

5.  **Configurability & Modularity**
    * Templates and schemas are flexible and evolve with project needs.
    * The system is extensible, allowing new analysis types and "Paradigm Shifts" to be added without breaking the core.

6.  **Automation as Culture**
    * Automated indexing, linking, and validation are the norm.
    * Manual maintenance is a failure mode; the system must sustain itself through the Agent Workflow.

## Strategic Context

This library is a living system designed for integration, synthesis, and the ongoing capture of wisdom. It rejects the "Write Once, Read Never" pattern of traditional documentation in favor of a **Knowledge Graph** that actively informs future decisions.
