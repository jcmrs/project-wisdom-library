# Foundation Principles

This repository embodies **Holistic System Thinking** and **AI-First** collaboration.

## Imperatives

- **Holistic System Thinking:** Every analysis and distillation considers ripple effects, emergent outcomes, and system interplay.
- **AI-First:** Designed for autonomous AI agent workflows and strategic context owner (“on the loop”) validation.
- **Process Memory as Living Context:** Capture operations, pivots, decisions, and feedback.
- **Configurability, Modularity, Extensibility:** Templates and schemas are flexible and evolve with project/library needs.
- **Automation:** Automated indexing, linking, and validation are the norm.

## Strategic Context

This library is not just a catalogue—it's a living system designed for integration, synthesis, and the ongoing capture of wisdom as projects and investigations evolve.
