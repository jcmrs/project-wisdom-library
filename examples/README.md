# Examples

This directory contains example artifacts demonstrating the automated conceptual distillation workflow.

## Contents

### Example Artifacts

1. **`example-atomic-analysis.md`**
   - Demonstrates atomic analysis using Decision Forensics methodology
   - Shows proper template usage and structure
   - Illustrates strategic context capture and ripple effect documentation

2. **`example-process-memory.md`**
   - Shows process memory capture for strategic decisions
   - Demonstrates how insights and pivots are documented
   - Illustrates connection between investigation and learning

3. **`example-manifest-entries.md`**
   - Provides complete manifest.json entry examples
   - Shows proper metadata structure and cross-linking
   - Demonstrates different artifact types in manifest format

## Learning from Examples

### For AI Agents

Study these examples to understand:
- **Template Usage**: How to properly fill out each template type
- **Cross-Linking**: How artifacts reference each other
- **Strategic Context**: Level of detail needed for strategic context capture
- **Metadata Structure**: Complete manifest entry format with all optional fields
- **Workflow Flow**: How one investigation spawns multiple artifacts

### For Humans

Use these examples as:
- **Quality Standards**: Target level of detail and structure
- **Reference Templates**: Copy structure for similar investigations
- **Training Materials**: Understanding the workflow and outputs

## Example Scenario Walkthrough

The examples tell a cohesive story:

1. **Initial Request**: Team questions JWT authentication choice during security audit
2. **Investigation**: Decision forensics analysis traces original decision rationale
3. **Process Memory**: Strategic insights captured about knowledge management patterns
4. **Follow-Up**: Backlog items created for documentation improvements
5. **Future Ideas**: Meta-pattern synthesis opportunity identified
6. **Catalogue Update**: All artifacts properly linked in manifest

This demonstrates:
- Complete workflow from intake to PR
- Multiple artifact types working together
- Cross-linking and knowledge graph building
- Strategic context preservation
- Actionable outcomes

## Using These Examples

### As Templates
1. Copy the structure of the relevant example
2. Replace content with your investigation details
3. Maintain the format and section structure
4. Ensure all required fields are filled

### As Validation
- Compare your artifacts against these examples
- Verify similar level of detail and completeness
- Check that your manifest entries match the structure
- Ensure cross-links are bidirectional

### As Learning Tools
- Study how strategic context is captured
- Note the depth of analysis in findings
- Observe how ripple effects are documented
- See how recommendations connect to backlog items

## Key Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Strategic Context Capture
Examples show that strategic context includes:
- Why the investigation was needed
- What uncertainties exist
- What decisions depend on findings
- Who the stakeholders are

### 2. Completeness
Examples demonstrate complete artifacts with:
- All template sections filled
- Specific, actionable findings
- Clear recommendations
- Proper cross-linking

### 3. Cross-Linking
Examples show how to:
- Reference related artifacts by ID
- Maintain bidirectional links
- Connect investigations to process memory
- Link backlog items to source analyses

### 4. Metadata Richness
Examples include:
- Comprehensive tagging
- Target identification
- Author attribution
- Status tracking
- Custom metadata fields

## Quality Checklist
