# Examples

This directory contains the **Ground Truth** training data for the Project Wisdom Library. Agents must strictly follow these patterns to ensure "Holistic System Thinking" and "Protocol Compliance."

## The "Wisdom Ladder" Examples

The examples are structured to demonstrate the progression from Data to Wisdom:

1.  **`example-atomic-analysis.md`** (Level 1-2)
    * *Use Case:* Quick Decision Forensics or Architecture Mapping.
    * *Key Feature:* Focused findings with direct strategic context alignment.

2.  **`example-process-memory.md`** (Level 3)
    * *Use Case:* Capturing Epistemic History and Strategic Decisions.
    * *Key Feature:* **Dual-Layer Structure.**
        * **Layer 1 (Narrative):** Human-readable "Evolution of Thought" and "Roads Not Taken."
        * **Layer 2 (Protocol):** Strict JSON block for the System Owner (Manifest mapping).

3.  **`example-manifest-entries.md`** (System Maintenance)
    * *Use Case:* Updating the Catalogue.
    * *Key Feature:* Shows how to map the Internal Protocol (JSON) to the External Manifest fields.

## Critical Agent Instructions

* **Do not Hallucinate Formats:** If the template requires a JSON block, you **must** generate valid JSON.
* **Do not Skip the "Why":** Every example demonstrates capturing the *Subjective Strategic Context*.
* **Do not Break the Ladder:** Do not attempt Level 4 (Wisdom) synthesis without citing Level 1 (Data) evidence.
