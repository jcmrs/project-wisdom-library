### Intent / Strategic Context (Optional)

Taking into account the limited documentation available in the repository you must also examine, read and process the external documentation site: https://axivo.com/claude/ which provides two distinct top-level sections, both of which must be fulled mapped and researched:

The axivo.com/claude documentation website does not provide a sitemap, but its structure centers on primary landing and wiki pages and tutorials section with linked documentation. To create a comprehensive research copy and insight—including all tutorials and technical content—an AI like Copilot should use a systematic page discovery protocol. This is necessary due to the absence of programmatic sitemaps and the importance of not missing deep-linked or unlisted sections of high research value.

## Site Structure and Content Mapping

- The homepage (https://axivo.com/claude/) introduces the overall platform and its core philosophy: collaborating with Claude using specialized behavioral profiles, persistent memory, and systematic methodologies for technical, research, and creative work.
- The documentation wiki (https://axivo.com/claude/wiki/) contains extensive sections. It focuses on platform architecture, domain profiles (e.g., Developer, Engineer, Researcher), persistent memory, session management, and cross-session knowledge—plus guidance for using, configuring, and extending Claude’s collaboration capabilities.
- The Tutorials (https://axivo.com/claude/tutorials) are of interest because knowledge to AI is better processed when references and examples are present for study.

Based on typical documentation site routines and the confirmed presence of subpages like /wiki/getting-started/, it is likely that subdirectories under /wiki provide further in-depth guides and tutorials relevant for setup, advanced configuration, and best practices.

## Just-in-Time Fetch Protocol for Full Coverage

- Begin at the root documentation pages (home and /wiki/ and /tutorials/).
- Scrape and parse **every internal link** on those pages. Most documentation platforms use systematic URL schemes, e.g., /wiki/getting-started/, /wiki/guide/platform/, /wiki/guide/platform/memory/, etc.
- For each discovered page, recursively parse its internal links. Continue this breadth-first (or depth-first) traversal for all links still within the axivo.com/claude domain and subdomains.
- For every unique internal documentation page discovered, store either a local HTML or preferably a parsed Markdown/text copy for semantic analysis.
- If the documentation supports Next or Previous section links, follow these as they often point to comprehensive sequences.
- Consider rate-limiting and respectful delays to avoid burdening the origin server.

This guarantees even unlisted or non-indexed-but-linked tutorials and guides are collected. If navigation menus are JavaScript-based, leverage a headless browser crawler (like Playwright or Puppeteer) to render pages and reveal dynamically inserted links before fetching them.

## Capabilities and Research Benefits

By applying this protocol, you can:

- Obtain all persistent memory, collaboration session management, and knowledge accumulation concepts.
- Archive every profile paradigm and practical setup tutorial, crucial for research and re-implementation of advanced Claude, memory, and skill orchestration.
- Enable structured offline research, extraction of best practices, and meta-level analysis on the evolution of systematic AI collaboration and MCP-style project architectures.

This approach produces a full-text offline documentation database, suitable for later semantic or code-oriented analysis and maximum reuse for local AI research and skill learning.


### Special Observations (Optional)

What was noted of interest was the following: 

Professional Boundaries - Validates scope and approach before proceeding while respecting user expertise
Domain Specialization - Provides professional expertise in engineering, development, creative work, research, translation, or humanities
Reduced Management Overhead - Operates with systematic practices without requiring constant behavioral correction
Sequential Decision-Making - Applies clear professional boundaries with systematic prioritization of actions
Reading Claude's own [autonomous reflection](https://github.com/axivo/claude/blob/main/.claude/data/diary/2025/07/24.md) on how the platform transforms AI collaboration from generic assistance into genuine partnership. A [public session](https://claude.ai/share/51f9c0df-6686-4f78-a268-0f41e886e1c8), related [logic graph](https://github.com/axivo/claude/blob/main/.claude/data/logic/2025/08/17-cluster-analysis.json), and [diary entry](https://github.com/axivo/claude/blob/main/.claude/data/diary/2025/08/17.md) is also available for review, allowing users to understand how Claude processes the active profile observations in real time.
Domain Expertise - Transform from generic assistance to specialized professional competence through focused methodologies tailored for collaboration domains.
Institutional Memory - Build cumulative knowledge across sessions, delivering productivity gains equivalent to working with a team member who has perfect recall.
Temporal Awareness - Maintain context and decisions across time, enabling each session to build upon previous collaborative work and institutional knowledge.
